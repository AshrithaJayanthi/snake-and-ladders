   ^_^ Welcome to Snake and Ladder Game ^_^.
 

    Rules to be followed:
      1. Initially both the players are at the position 0 on the board. 
         Each player gets to roll the dice and move forward. 
         Move forward the number of spaces shown on the dice.
      2. If your dice lands on a ladder, you can move up to the top of the ladder :D.
      3. But If your dice lands on the head of a snake, you must slide down to the bottom of the snake :(.
      4. The first player who goes to the FINAL POSITION is the winner of the game.
      5. TO ROLL THE DICE PLEASE PRESS "ENTER".
